## EECS 738 Project 4: Reinforcement Learning by Matthew Taylor

### Overview

The purpose of this project is to implement a reinforcement learning policy to model situational assessments, actions, and rewards programmatically. Multiple two-dimensional maze-like environments with goals/treasures (yellow squares), walls (black squares), and enemies (red squares) were created to test the agent (green square). Q-learning was implemented to 'teach' the agent how to quickly obtain treasures and avoid enemies. The amount of time taken to collect all treasures and the number of enemies fought served as metrics to gauge the performance of the agent. GIFs were created for each environment to easily illustrate the agent's behavior and the efficacy of the training algorithm.
